        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Buisness</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello I am a Pre-Buisness Major. I am a reliable person who people can count on.<br><br>

        I am a person of various skills. I can use multiple websites and tools that will be benefical to you. I am also a person who is open and is a perosn many can talk to. I am not very judgemental as well. Some other things about me here you are; anime, reading, playing video games, disney, hulu, netflix, doom, pokemon, drawing, funko pops, shopping, hot topic, saving moneyt, the new xbox,the new ps5, cyberpunk being the top game of 2020, the pandemic sucks, I want to go out and hangout with friends to go on a roadtrip, I want my job at disney as well. <br><br>

        If you would like to work with me please message me at one of my available medias. If you would like to know my personal interest as ways of starting a conversation, here they are. I like to cook, anime, reading, playing video games, not doing homework but doing work. anime, reading, playing video games anime, reading, playing video games anime, reading, playing video games anime, reading, playing video games anime, reading, playing video games anime, reading, playing video games. Not only do I enjoy this, especially anime, reading, playing video games, but I love christmas, family boy, anything new and i Havent done, traveling though i have never traveled in my life, to meet new people and expanded on how people think versuse me. Because after all everyone thinks different but there are similiarities in certain things. But by knowing the things i do not kmow then I can use this to better me and to better hoe I treat others. Hopefuly one day though I won't have to be so cautions as being a male many things can go wrong by the simplist things in todays world. Though people say that men hold all the power and stuff, This can be easily overthrown as women are more of the population than we are so they can gang up on us. And even now, with a false accusation of rape or sexual harrasment/assult peoples lives can be ruined, why? Because even if theres not stustainal evidence in court, just hearing this will set people in a rampage. The male who is accused can lose their job, family, friends, reputation, everything even if they are not guilty. It can be related to the witch trials, except those were more frequent and people were just saying it and using terrible test. Why I put this i do not know, is it factually right? Most likely not in accused rape cases. I am not a lawyer nor a person whos done enough reserach into this. I am just tryng to fill five hundrad words.And I am still not, I am at four hun and sixty six. So I am just gonna continue to write my thoughts because dang this is super long for a lab. Yes will we need 500 words for this, its crazy because this is an imaginary scenario. Technacilly for a bio of this sorts it depends om what we are bioing ourselfs for. Yes it is a homework assignment and yes I have to follow through,I get it.But after college is real lfe, right? So wouldn't your bio be what you want it to be or if it soemthing for a buisness website then you would make a boi for it that is professional but the length can be however long. Well i Finished so goodbye.
